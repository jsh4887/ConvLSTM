# ConvLSTM
Source code of ConvLSTM model

# Prerequisites
This project is run in Python 3 and mainly uses Tensorflow
* pip install numpy
* pip install pandas
* pip install pickle
* pip install scikit-learn
* pip install tensorflow

# Run
- You can run the codes in order starting from number 1. (1. Make_dataset.py, 2. Run_ConvLSTM_Save_model.py, 3. Load_model_save_results.py)
- When you make the dataset, you have to decide past history and future target in "1. Make_dataset.py" code.
- You can change other hyperparameters such as batch size, epoch, the number of filters, etc. in "2. Run_ConvLSTM_Save_model.py" code.
